# TK_Tic_Tac_Toe
Short excercise to test implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe using Tkinter.

Sets up a small interface, Player always starts as X. AI plays as O. First it will go for a winning move, then a lose blocking move, then chooses randomly.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
Change AI to its own API, set up remote play/multiplayer through use of GAME_ID

EXCERCISE CONSIDERED GOOD ENOUGH TO TEST PERSONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TKINTER PACKAGE, WILL NOT BE FURTHER DEVELOPED
